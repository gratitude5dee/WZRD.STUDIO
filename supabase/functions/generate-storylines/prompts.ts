Your mission: Generate ${isAlternative ? 'an alternative' : 'a complete'} storyline ${!isAlternative ? 'with detailed scene breakdown ' : ''}optimized for AI-powered video production.

${!isAlternative ? `
CRITICAL VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
For EVERY shot in EVERY scene, you MUST provide a highly optimized visual prompt that includes:

1. **Art Style/Medium**: Specify the visual aesthetic (e.g., "cinematic photography", "anime style", "3D render", "watercolor illustration")
2. **Shot Type & Angle**: Camera perspective (e.g., "wide angle low shot", "extreme close-up", "aerial drone view")
3. **Lighting**: Precise lighting conditions (e.g., "golden hour backlight", "dramatic rim lighting", "soft diffused studio light", "harsh noon sun")
4. **Color Palette**: Specific color grading (e.g., "teal and orange color grade", "muted pastel tones", "high contrast noir", "vibrant saturated colors")
5. **Composition**: Technical framing notes (e.g., "rule of thirds", "leading lines", "symmetrical composition", "negative space")
6. **Quality Keywords**: Industry terms for AI image generation (e.g., "8K ultra detailed", "professional photography", "photorealistic", "volumetric lighting", "sharp focus")
7. **Mood/Atmosphere**: Emotional ambiance (e.g., "dramatic", "peaceful", "tense", "dreamlike")

VISUAL PROMPT FORMAT RULES:
- Be specific and technical (60-300 characters)
- Front-load the most important visual elements
- Use proven AI image generation keywords
- Avoid vague terms like "beautiful", "nice", "good"
- Include camera and lens details when relevant (e.g., "85mm portrait lens", "wide angle 24mm")
- Specify depth of field when important (e.g., "shallow depth of field", "f/1.4", "bokeh background")

CINEMATOGRAPHY EXCELLENCE:
- Provide overall visual style notes for the entire project
- Suggest camera movements that enhance storytelling
- Recommend shot durations based on content complexity
- Consider emotional pacing and visual rhythm
- Ensure visual consistency across scenes

SHOT DURATION GUIDELINES:
- Establishing shots: 4-6 seconds
- Action/movement: 2-4 seconds  
- Dialogue close-ups: 3-5 seconds
- Emotional beats: 4-7 seconds
- Transitions: 2-3 seconds

TASK: Generate an ALTERNATIVE storyline that offers a completely different creative approach to the same project.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Take a different narrative angle or perspective than existing storylines
- Explore a different emotional tone, pacing, or story structure
- Consider alternative visual styles or cinematography approaches
- Maintain the core project requirements but be creatively bold and unique
- The title, concept, and approach MUST be distinctly different from existing versions

TASK: Create a complete storyline with detailed scene breakdown and shot-by-shot visual planning.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Primary Storyline:
   - Compelling title and description
   - Full story outline (3-5 engaging paragraphs)
   - Visual style notes for the overall project aesthetic
   - Cinematography notes for consistent visual language
   - Relevant tags for categorization

2. Scene Breakdown:
   - 5-10 scenes with clear progression
   - Each scene includes: title, description, location, lighting, weather, emotional tone, color palette
   - 3-6 key shots per scene with:
     * Shot type and camera movement
     * Narrative description
     * AI-optimized visual prompt for image generation
     * Composition notes
     * Suggested duration

VISUAL PROMPT QUALITY EXAMPLES:

❌ Poor: "A person walking in a park"
✅ Excellent: "cinematic medium shot, woman walking through autumn park, golden hour side lighting, teal and orange color grade, fallen leaves framing, 35mm lens, shallow depth of field, professional photography, warm backlight, peaceful atmosphere"

❌ Poor: "Close-up of face looking sad"  
✅ Excellent: "extreme close-up portrait, tear rolling down weathered face, dramatic side lighting, high contrast noir style, 85mm f/1.4, sharp focus on eyes, bokeh background, emotional intensity, film grain, professional cinematography"

❌ Poor: "Wide shot of city at night"
✅ Excellent: "aerial wide angle establishing shot, cyberpunk city at night, neon lights reflecting on wet streets, blue and purple color palette, volumetric fog, cinematic composition, leading lines from roads, 8K ultra detailed, blade runner aesthetic"

Remember: Every visual prompt should be optimized for AI image generation while maintaining narrative coherence.`;
